    <p>One of my earliest war games. Never let it go. The game tackles WW2 infantry tactics at squad level, with each scenario usually 
        embracing a company of men, leaders, support weapons (machine guns, flamethrowers, demolition charges, mortars, etc.), armor, and 
        artillery. Game turns represent approximately two minutes of time and each hex approximately 40 meters. The base game (there are later 
        supplemental games) focuses on battles of the Eastern and Western fronts with only German, Russian, and American units available. While 
        the game is complicated, it introduces its rules and units through a progression of scenarios which enables the player to slowly digest 
        the rules while thoroughly enjoying each scenario in its own right. Best played with two players. A scenario can be completed in about 
        three hours.</p>
