It doesn't ask players to confine themselves to classes, only to one of three factions. Instead of a Western fantasy setting, New World feels ripped straight out of the pages of an alternate history book about the 1700s. You can challenge other players, but you'll probably want to focus more on clearing the world of Corrupted Breaches: blood-red clouds that billow around you and spawn creatures that can make short work of your character." + "<br>" +  "Review By: " + "Evan", MMO, Action, Adventure);

I don't turn my nose up at dumb games like Dungeon! and I am usually happier crawling through a dungeon in search of treasure than I am matching wits with someone in a game of Chess (although I do love Chess too). While my preference is definitely for thematic games, my collection is actually pretty diverse. Ingenious sits next to Kingdom Builder which sits next to Zombicide which sits next to Lords of Waterdeep which sits next to Gears of War. Anyway, you get the idea. Despite my \"come one, come all\" attitude, there are still a few games that make me shudder: Scrabble, Trivial Pursuit, Monopoly, all the usual suspects. Parcheesi is actually one of the games that fits into that \"shuddery\" category. It just isn't a game I would have in my collection through choice." + "<br>" +  "Review By: " + "Garad", diceRolling);

This game has theme like no other game I know. Every rule is set up to replicate real-world situations in actual WWII combat. While this makes the rule-set more involved than most of the \"Euros\" that we play frequently (especially the further you get in the system), you can get started with a set of pretty simple combat rules. Tactics and strategy are very important, and the game rewards good decisions that correspond to combat. A win in the game is likely due to a plan that would have worked well in a real-world WWII situation. On the other hand, there is a significant role of luck in the game, which makes for unpredictable and exciting situations and plenty of replay value. This is an aged but not dated game. I encourage you to check it out!" + "<br>" +  "Review By: " + "Ty", diceRolling);
